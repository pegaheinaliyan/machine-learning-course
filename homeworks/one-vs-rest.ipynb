    "# Homework #3.2: One vs. Rest\n",
    "\n",
    "This homework is about multinomial classification using OVR technique. Do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Get iris dataset from `sklearn` using `sklearn.datasets.load_iris()`.\n",
    "2. There are 3 classes (labels): 0, 1 and 2. Peek class 0 and convert all of the zeros in $ y $ vector to one. Convert the rest labels (1s and 2s) to zero.\n",
    "3. Create a `LogisticRegression` model and fit it on $ X $ and the new $ y $. Get predictions (the probabilities) from the model with `.predict_proba()` function.\n",
    "4. Do steps 2 and 3 once again for class 1 and once for class 2.\n",
    "5. Now you have 3 probabilities: one for class 0, one for 1 and one for 2. The real class for each data item is the maximum probability among its 3 probability. For example if data item number 5 has 0.1 probability for class 0, 0.7 for class 1 and 0.4 for class 2, its true class is 1.\n",
    "6. Draw a 2D plot using `matplotlib` to show that the OVR classification works well.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information:  \n",

    "(Note: in this example, it has used `LogisticRegression` once for OVR but you should use it 3 times)\n",
